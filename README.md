# memoryGAN

Pytorch implementation of [Memorization Precedes Generation: Learning Unsupervised GANs with Memory Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01500) by Youngjin Kim, Minjung Kim, Gunhee Kim.

A slightly Tensorflow modified version of the authors' original code can be found in the submodule `memoryGAN_tf`.
